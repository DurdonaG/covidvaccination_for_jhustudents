# COVID- 19 Vaccinations for international students at JHU

## Background

Earlier this semester Johns Hopkins University announced its plans for the staged return of activity back to its campuses, with the hope and expectation that the university will be substantially back to normal this fall.  A fundamental part of this plan is that they will require all students coming or returning to campuses this fall, and who do not require religious or health exemptions, to be vaccinated. As Hopkins has indicated, they strongly urge, and may soon require, all faculty and staff to be vaccinated as well.

Multiple vaccines (from Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, and Johnson & Johnson) have been demonstrated to provide high levels of protection against the COVID virus with reports of only minimal and brief side effects following administration. However, not all countries have had the same access to vaccinations. As a global university with students from all over the world, it is important for Hopkins to consider the global vaccination accessibility. Therefore, this report is analysis of vaccination trends for five countries from where the largest percentage of international students at Hopkins come from.

## Business Question

What does mandating a vaccination mean for JHU and how Hopkins should think about getting students vaccinated?

## Data Question 

Analyze vaccine dose availability by country  


## Data Analysis and Visualizations

First we perform geospatial analysis on JHU and its popularity is globally. We analyse international student trends at Johns Hopkins University to discover how Johns Hopkins stacks up to the competition when it comes to serving students from outside the United States.

Following maps show Popularity ranking of JHU by country and Value ranking of JHU by country:

Then, from https://www.collegefactual.com/colleges/johns-hopkins-university/student-life/international/chart-international.html we can extract 5 countries with the highest percentage of Hopkins students:
1. China 3,260
2. India 429
3. South Korea 331
4. Canada 219 
5. Turkey 41

Next, we look at the Covid-19 vaccination trends in these countries and do analysis on them.

### How fast are countries vaccinating?

Among countries with more than 1 million people, Mongolia is currently vaccinating faster than any other, administering a daily average of 2,289 doses per 100,000 people in the past seven days. Their fastest was about 2,289 doses per 100,000 people per day.


### Do some countries have an advantage?

Yes, generally richer and more developed countries have better health care infrastructure to manufacture, acquire and administer doses.

About 55% of people who have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine were from high income countries, and at least 53% were from Europe and North America (that only includes data from countries that report these figures).


### Who is getting vaccinated?

Because of the limited availability of vaccines, most countries are prioritizing certain groups of people to receive their shots before others. People who are older or more likely to become very ill or die from COVID-19 are usually prioritized over those who are young and healthy. Some groups are prioritized because they are more likely to come into contact with an infected person based on what they do or where they live and, in turn, infect others.


## Conclusion 

To conclude, vaccination availabilitty differs by country depending on various factors such as health care infrastructure to manafacture.
